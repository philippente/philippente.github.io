        		<h2>Robust Manipulation with Model-based Reinforcement Learning via Generative Controller Models</h2>
				<p>
Model-based reinforcement learning can enable robots to learn efficiently control policies for complex manipulation tasks. High-dimensional neural networks are one of the most general policy representations. However, due to a small number of real-world trajectory samples in model-based reinforcement learning, the resulting neural networks generalize only in the neighborhood of the sample distribution generated by real-world interactions. In this paper, we present Generative Controller Models. Generative controller models are able to generate stabilizing actions over a broader state space compared to previous methods. Given a latent state, Generative Controller Models create a local stable closed-loop controller, which is then used to compute an action. Our approach is derived directly from an iterative Linear-Quadratic Regulator-based reinforcement learning algorithm. In contrast to direct state-action policies, Generative Controller Models learn explicitly the stabilizing properties of linear-feedback controllers. We evaluate the presented method in simulated and real-world simulated manipulation tasks, including contact-rich peg-in-hole tasks. Generative Controller Models lead to robust robot motions requiring less training data compared to previous methods. 					<br>
