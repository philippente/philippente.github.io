        		<h2>Robust Manipulation with Model-based Reinforcement Learning via Generative Controller Models</h2>
				<p>
				   Model-based reinforcement learning can enable robots to learn efficiently control policies for complex manipulation tasks. High-dimensional neural networks are one of the most general policy representations.
However, due to a small number of real-world trajectory samples in model-based reinforcement learning, typically, the resulting neural networks generalize only in the neighborhood of the sample distribution generated by real-world interactions.
In this paper, we present Generative Controller Models. Generative controller models are able to generate stabilizing controllers over a broader state space as previous methods. 
Given a latent state, Generative Controller Models create a local stable closed-loop controller. 
Our approach is derived directly from an iLQR based reinforcement learning algorithm, trained on a sequence of linear-feedback controllers. 
In contrast to direct state-action policies, our method learns explicitly the stabilizing properties of linear-feedback controllers. 
We evaluate the presented method in real-world and simulated manipulation tasks, including contact-rich peg-in-hole tasks. Generative Controller Models lead to robust robot motions requiring less training data compared to previous methods.
