        		<h2>Learning Robust Manipulation Skills with Guided Policy Search via Generative Motor Reflexes</h2>
				<p>
Guided Policy Search enables robots to learn control policies for complex manipulation tasks efficiently. Therein, the control policies are represented as high-dimensional neural networks, which derive robot actions based on states. 
However, due to the small number of real-world trajectory samples in Guided Policy Search, the resulting neural networks are only robust in the neighborhood of the trajectory distribution generated by real-world interactions.
In this paper, we present a new policy representation called \textit{Generative Motor Reflexes}, which is able to generate robust actions over a broader state space compared to previous methods. 
In contrast to prior state-action policies, Generative Motor Reflexes map from states to parameters for a motor reflex, which is then used to derive an action.
Then, robustness is achived by generating similar motor reflexes for arbitrary states. For a motor reflex we make use of linear Gaussian controllers that are an intermediate result of previous Guided Policy Search approaches.
We evaluate the presented method in simulated and real-world manipulation tasks, including contact-rich peg-in-hole tasks. We show that policies represented as Generative Motor Reflexes lead to robust robot motions also outside the training distribution with less exploration needs compared to previous methods. Therefore, the presented approach can serve as a step towards reliable applications of reinforcement learning for manipulation.
