        		<h2>Learning Robust Manipulation Skills with Guided Policy Search via Generative Motor Reflexes</h2>
				<p>
 Guided Policy Search enables robots to learn control policies for complex manipulation tasks efﬁciently. Therein, the control policies are represented as high-dimensional neural
networks, which derive robot actions based on states. However, due to thw small number of real-world trajectory samples
in Guided Policy Search, the resulting neural networks are only robust in the neighborhood of the trajectory distribution
generated by real-world interactions. In this paper, we present a new policy representation called Generative Motor Reﬂexes,
which is able to generate robust actions over a broader state space compared to previous methods. In contrast to prior state-
action policies, Generative Motor Reﬂexes map from states to parameters for a motor reﬂex, which is then used to derive an
action. Then, robustness is achived by generating similar motor reﬂexes for arbitrary states. For a motor reﬂex we make use
of linear-Gaussian controllers that are an intermediate result of previous Guided Policy Search approaches. We evaluate the
presented method in simulated and real-world manipulation tasks, including contact-rich peg-in-hole tasks. We show that
policies represented as Generative Motor Reﬂexes lead to robust robot motions also outside the training distribution with less
exploration needs compared to previous methods. Therefore, the presented approach can serve as a step towards practical applications of reinforcement learning for manipulation.
